## ‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture

### ‚û§ Embedded Flight Control System
- Developed discrete **PID controllers** for pitch, roll, yaw, and altitude, each running at ~50 Hz.
- Stabilized body frame errors using sensor fusion data from the drone's onboard IMU.
- Implemented **anti-windup compensation** in integral terms to prevent control saturation.

### ‚û§ Finite State Machine (FSM) for Mission Execution
- Mission stages included:
  - Idle ‚Üí Takeoff ‚Üí Waypoint Traverse ‚Üí Obstacle Avoidance ‚Üí Hover ‚Üí Landing.
- State transitions were triggered by sensor thresholds (altitude, position error) and mission progress flags.

### ‚û§ Autonomous Waypoint Navigation
- Waypoints defined as relative X-Y-Z coordinates.
- Used **cubic spline interpolation** for smooth trajectory generation.
- Applied feedforward velocity planning combined with closed-loop positional corrections.

### ‚û§ Obstacle Detection & Avoidance (Simulated)
- Modeled virtual obstacles in MATLAB simulation.
- Implemented simple reactive avoidance (heading and altitude shift) when obstacle zones were detected.

### ‚û§ Embedded Deployment
- Converted the Simulink model to optimized C code using Embedded Coder.
- Deployed via **MATLAB Simulink Support Package** directly onto the Parrot Minidrone.
- Real-time data logging enabled via BLE telemetry.
